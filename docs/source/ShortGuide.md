Short Guide
===========

1. Open the QGIS plugin dialog (```Plugins > Manage and install plugins...```), and then install Qgis2threejs plugin.

2. Load a raster DEM file using `Add Raster Layer` and any other layers into QGIS, and set the project CRS to a projected coordinate system (the unit should be the same as that of DEM values).

3. Zoom to your favorite place, and click the plugin button in the web toolbar. ![plugin icon](../../icon.png)
