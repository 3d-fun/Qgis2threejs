Short Guide
===========

Let's start using Qgis2threejs plugin!

1. Open the QGIS plugin dialog
   (``Plugins > Manage and install plugins...``), and then install
   Qgis2threejs plugin.

2. Load a raster DEM file using ``Add Raster Layer`` and any other
   layers into QGIS, and set the project CRS to a projected coordinate
   system (the unit should be the same as that of DEM values).

3. Zoom to your favorite place, and click the plugin button in the web
   toolbar. |plugin icon|
