description=[Experimental] This template can simulate sunlight. Buildings and terrain cast shadow behind them.
    NOTE: Use an appropriate CRS, otherwise you cannot get correct result. Ideally,
    - North-south direction and (horizontally) up-down direction should be equal throughout the extent.
    - Scale along horizontal direction and scale along vertical direction should be equal.
